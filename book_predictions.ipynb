    "Recommender systems are common in our daily lives, being used by companies like Amazon to suggest products to purchase and by streaming services to recommend movies or TV shows to watch. In this project  we will build a book recommendation system  to provide personalized book suggestions to our users.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a brief introduction to recommendation systems, we will export the cleaned and explored data from our previous Jupyter notebook and begin building our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that suggests the most relevant items to a particular user or customer. There are various types of recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering, content-based systems, and knowledge-based recommendation systems. These systems utilize different techniques to analyze user data and generate personalized recommendations based on factors such as user preferences, behavior, and past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering: generates recommendations based on the interests of similar users. This method requires historical activity data for the users. For this project we will be using users' past book rating. Collaborative filtering algorithms can be user-based or item-based. User-based algorithms recommend items to a user based on the preferences of similar users, while item-based algorithms recommend items based on the past ratings of similar items by the user.\n",
    "   * Baseline Estimates: are used in collaborative filtering to give as a baseline prediction for the user-item interaction (like ratin. The baseline estimate can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "       Baseline estimate = Global mean rating + User bias + Item bias\n",
    "   * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one  of the basic  algorithms used in collaborative filtering algorithm. The way the algorithm work by computing the K-nearest neighbors of a given user or item based on their past rating and then using their ratings to predict the rating of an unrated item or to generate a list of recommended items. This approach could be simple and effective but has some limitation like scaling to large dataset. To address these challenges and improve recommendation other collaborative filtering algorithm have been developed, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) base on matrix factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a popular matrix factorization algorithm used in recommendation systems. It decomposes the user-item rating matrix into three matrices that capture the underlying structure of the data. SVD has proved to be effective in many recommendation applications and  was one of the main algorithms used by the winning team of the Netflix Prize competition. However, This algrothim also have it's limitaions. SVS suffer r form scalability problem because a facortizaing of large matrices need large amount of computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based systems: suggest similar items based on a particular item metadata. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, they will also like an item that is similar to it. However, the only metadata we have about the books in our dataset is the title, author, and country, which is very limited. A good metadata for content-based systems would be the genres and  summary the the book, but unfortunately, we do not have that information. Additionally, this method is computationally expensive, which further limits its use. For these reasons, we will only use collaborative filtering in our book recommendation system."
