 Summary of the project (provided by Hanna Abi Akl) :
 
 Nowadays with so many books available, it can be hard to select the best ones to read. The
dataset provided is a curation of Goodreads books based on real user information. It can be
used for many tasks like predicting a book’s rating or recommending new books.

1) bookID: A unique identification number for each book.

Standard Book Number.
6) isbn13: A 13-digit ISBN to identify the book, instead of the standard 11-digit ISBN.
7) language_code: Indicates the primary language of the book. For instance, “eng” is
