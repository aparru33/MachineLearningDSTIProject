**Project: Book Recommendation System**


We have chosen to build a recommender system based on the data provided by kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset. 
The project is done in three steps which each have their jupyter notebook:
* [Data Cleaning](cleaning_data.ipynb)
* [Exploratory Data Analysis](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
* [Book Predictions](book_predictions.ipynb)

The python libraries installed for the project are in the files requirement.txt
